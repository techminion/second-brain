# AI Handoff Log

> **Every AI session must append an entry here before ending** (newest first). The goal: any agent — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or a future tool — can read the top entry plus [PROJECT_STATE.md](PROJECT_STATE.md) and continue immediately. Session protocol: [.ai/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md](../.ai/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md).

## 2026-07-16 — Claude (TPM / governance)

**Session Date:** 2026-07-16
**Agent:** Claude (Claude Code), acting as Technical Program Manager / Staff Architect / Lead Reviewer
**Objective:** Create the project-management and agent-governance layer on top of the completed 12-document engineering spec; run a full-set consistency review.
**Files Modified:** `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (corrected doc filenames, replaced nonexistent `project/` paths with real `docs/`+`.ai/` locations, aligned workflow with `.ai/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`, added `.ai/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` and `agents/` pointers); `docs/DOCUMENT_INDEX.md` (added Governance & Process Documents section).
**Files Added:** `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/MILESTONES.md`, `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`; `.ai/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `.ai/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`, `.ai/ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`, `.ai/CODING_STANDARDS.md`, `.ai/TASK_QUEUE.md`; `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/labels.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/adr-proposal.md`; `agents/architect.md`, `agents/frontend.md`, `agents/backend.md`, `agents/database.md`, `agents/ai.md`, `agents/search.md`, `agents/mcp.md`, `agents/reviewer.md`, `agents/designer.md`; `README.md` (interim pointer version); `.gitignore` (local files excluded).
**Architecture Decisions:** GOV-1 through GOV-5 recorded in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) (milestone naming, TASK_QUEUE-vs-12_TASKS relationship, ADR registry model, `.ai/` digest authority rule, agent ownership boundaries).
**Outstanding Work:** "Vault vs. graph" terminology decision pending ([PROJECT_STATE.md](PROJECT_STATE.md)).
**Known Bugs:** None (no code).
**Risks:** Governance docs can drift from the 12-doc spec if agents edit digests instead of sources — mitigated by GOV-4 (digests always lose to `docs/`).
**Suggested Next Task:** Sprint 1 from [.ai/TASK_QUEUE.md](../.ai/TASK_QUEUE.md) — start with SETUP-01 (owner: backend) and DB-01 (owner: database); the two are parallelizable.
**Estimated Context Needed:** `.ai/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` + `.ai/TASK_QUEUE.md` + the task's referenced doc sections (~15–20k tokens). Full doc set not required for SETUP tasks.
